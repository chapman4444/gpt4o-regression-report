GPT-4o Regression Feedback — Request to Restore GPT-4-Turbo for Technical Projects
==================================================================================

Dear OpenAI Support,

Thank you for your response. I’m submitting this follow-up per your suggestion to share examples of GPT-4o unreliability in technical workflows. I’m a long-time GPT-4-turbo user with production-grade workflows in embedded development, Python automation, and GUI engineering. Since GPT-4o replaced GPT-4-turbo, the assistant has become **unreliable, disobedient, and structurally destructive** for my code tasks, even with strict instructions.

Here are three representative examples from real work sessions:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔧 Example 1: "Fix only" instructions ignored — Teensy IMU script overwritten
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
> “Fix only the quaternion rollover issue. Do not change structure, formatting, or spacing. Preserve all logic. One-line surgical fix only.”

Expected:
Minimal logic fix within `loop()`.

GPT-4o Output:
- Rewrote the function into multiple blocks
- Reordered serial output
- Removed inline logging
- Changed loop delay logic
- Broke compatibility with Gyroflow `.gcsv` parsing

Impact:
GPT-4o ignored explicit fix-only instructions. GPT-4-turbo reliably obeyed this directive 100+ times in similar sessions. This regression causes real delays in production debugging, since I cannot trust GPT-4o to leave the rest of the code intact.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠️ Example 2: GUI segmentation logic removed despite “Do Not Simplify” rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
> “Do not remove segmentation logic. Do not simplify or rewrite. Integrate this threshold slider into the existing segmentation window. Fix only the update logic.”

Expected:
Keep advanced `segment_image()` logic and just wire slider value to `threshold_value`.

GPT-4o Output:
- Removed entire `segment_image()` pipeline
- Deleted light normalization, regionprops, and distance transforms
- Injected a stubbed `cv2.threshold()` with no fallback
- Broke all working segmentation presets

Impact:
GPT-4o **disobeyed my Turbo instructions** and destroyed core logic I had spent hours refining. I never had this issue with GPT-4-turbo once strict mode was established. This was a fully modular Python GUI with separated logic. GPT-4o acted destructively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
💣 Example 3: Output omitted despite “full script” directive
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
> “Fix the tabs vs spaces error. Output full script in one block. Do not split.”

Expected:
Return the corrected version of the full file, exactly as is, with indentation fixed.

GPT-4o Output:
- Gave only the function body
- Said “rest unchanged” even though it altered spacing
- Broke indentation again in next line
- Removed comment blocks
- Ignored my formatting rules

Impact:
GPT-4-turbo followed this instruction perfectly across hundreds of iterations. GPT-4o now habitually “truncates”, splits, or omits blocks even with my standard Turbo boilerplate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 My Turbo Instructions for Reference
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I explicitly instruct GPT to operate in “Turbo-stable engineering mode.” This includes:
- Never simplify or reformat unless explicitly told
- Never remove or reorder lines
- Always return the full script in one block, regardless of size
- Fix only what I describe
- Warn before fixing unrelated bugs

**GPT-4o disobeys these rules regularly. GPT-4-turbo consistently respected them.**

📌 Request
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please consider the following actions:

1. **Restore GPT-4-turbo as an option** in the ChatGPT dropdown, or allow it in the API via model aliasing.
2. Offer a **“Strict Engineering Mode” toggle** for GPT-4o to avoid creative rewrites.
3. Create an **alpha / Pro Engineering tier** with access to more stable and conservative model behavior.

Thank you for your time and support. Please let me know if you’d like additional examples or session logs.

Sincerely,  
A longtime user and ChatGPT Plus subscriber
